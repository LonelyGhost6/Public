## LiPO Batteries
### Information about my own LiPo
* 2x Zeee 7.4v 2S 5200mAh
* 80c
* 7.4V
* 38.48Wh



Lithium-Ion Polymer Battery
Rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery
Uses gel polymer electrolyte instead of liquid
Higher specific energy than other lithium batteries
Used where weight is critical
Mobile devices, radio controlled: Aircraft, vehicles and robotics

* LiPo Battery consists of one or more cells
* Each cell has a **_Nominal voltage of 3.7 volts_**
* Nominal voltage is the default (resting) cell voltage
* **_Fully charged cell voltage is 4.4 volts_**
* **_Minimum safe charge is 3.0 volts_**

* Cells are combined in series
* Number of cells is "S" rating
* 2S Battery has 2 cells = 7.4v
* 3S Battery has 3 cells = 11.1v

* Cells can also be wired in parallel
* "P" rating for parallel cell banks
* 2S2P = 7.4v
* Not very common anymore

Battery capacity in milliamp hours (mAh)
Discharge rating is also called "C Rating"
Maximum charge rate also specified in "C"<br/>

Another rating is Internal Resistance (IR)
**_Measured in milliohms (mÎ©)_**
Measurement of cell efficiency
Changes over time and with temperature
Increases with battery age
**_Requires special test equipment to measure (So no multimeter)_**
Some advanced chargers can measure total IR
Battery total is total of individual cells

LiPo also has a Balance Connector
Has connection to each cell ^
Used to balance cell voltages
Can also be used during charging

Connectors:
* Deans connectors is most popular
* XT-60 connectors easy to solder
* EC3 Connectors is what my LiPo has (Popular with RC Aircraft) <br/>

* Traxxas Connectors Popular with RC Trucks and Cars
* Anderson Power Poles used to be created for HAM-RADIO
* Tamiya Connectors are basically Molex connectors

Balancer Plugs:
* JST-XH Plug (What my LiPo has)
* Thunder Power (TP) Plug

### Handy accesoires

CAPACITY CONTROLLER
https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07QB6D2Z5 <br />
![](img/LiPo-controller.png)
Basically a multimeter but designed for batteries <br />
Connect the LiPo via the balancing wire, will show the voltage level of the individual cells and shows capacity <br />

VOLTAGE MONITORS <br />
![](img/LiPo_Monitor.png)
https://amazon.nl/dp/B0BDPG49W9 <br />
https://amazon.nl/dp/B07DK3R4SY <br />
Has an alarm that warns when an individual cell drops below 3.6 Volts <br />
In case it does, change the battery or balance it <br />
Basically just monitors the voltage and warns when it goes bad <br />

SPLITTERS <br />
https://amazon.nl/dp/B084LB7CCZ <br />
To split the main female connector into 2 female connectors <br />

Charging <br />
* **_Must be charged with LiPo-specific charger_**
* **_Multi-use chargers MUST be set to Lithuim Polymer_**
* Balanced charging is the preferred method
* Charger needs to be set to correct number of cells
* **_Charge to maximum of 4.2 volts per cell_**

<!--
SAFETY
* Always check connections before charging
* Charge outdoors or in a well-ventilated area
* Never charge battery inside device
* Charge on a non-flammable surface
* Never charge a damaged or ballooned LiPo
* Never short-circuit output connector
* Have a fire extinguisher nearby
* **_NEVER LEAVE A CHARGING LiPo UNATTENDED_** -->
<br/>

* Safest charging current is 1C, don't exceed 1.5C
* Lifetime extended if "broken in" with 5-8 charge/discharge cycles
* **_Never discharge below 3 volts, or charge above 4.2 volts_**
* Watch LiPo for swelling during charging, stop if observed
* Direct charging (via output lead) is NOT recommended

IN PRACTISE
* USE A LiPo BAG
* Fire extinquisher nearby
* Non flammable surface - Pizza stone

### Discharging
<br/>

### Storage
* Batteries should be placed into "storage mode" when unused
* Cell voltage 3.8 - 3.85 volts during storage
* Never store a fully charged battery
* If not used in the next 24 hours, put it in storage mode
* Store between 10 and 50 degrees Celsius
* Store in fireproof enclosure
* Check periodically if stored long term
* **_USE AN AMMO CRATE FOR STORAGE_**...That's fucking amazing
* Put them in the battery bag, put that into an ammo box but do remove the rubber on the inside that makes it water and airtight. unless you want an unexpected pipe bomb
* Apparently drywall also works, if put inside a toolbox, surrounded by drywall...and the battery bag

I mean is up with this small explosive

### Fires
LiPo Batteries can experience thermal runaway
Charging battery with excessive Internal Resistance
Charging a damaged, ballooned or defective battery
Exposing a battery to heat above 60 degrees celsius
Exposing a battery to excessive shock or pressure
Gas released can be toxic and can cause an explosion

* LiPos actually contain very little lithium
* No need for Class D fire extinguisher
* Common Class ABC will work well
* Water CAN be used in the area around the burning LiPo
* **_Sand makes an excellent fire extinguisher_**
